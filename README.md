ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm @GalaxyGhostBat

ðŸš€ As a passionate student software developer based in the Netherlands, I'm on a mission to create immersive gaming experiences. My interests span the realms of programming, electronics, space, and science, and I can talk for hours about my hobbies.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not deep into coding or exploring the latest tech trends, you'll find me in the virtual worlds of gaming, or crafting my own games and programs. My ultimate goal? To either helm my own game development company or thrive as an indie game developer.

ðŸŒŒ Join me on this exciting journey through code and pixels, and let's build some unforgettable experiences together!
